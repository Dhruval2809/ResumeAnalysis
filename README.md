Overview:
The Automated Resume Analysis project is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the recruitment process through advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Leveraging SpaCy for entity recognition and various NLP tools for text analysis, this project aims to automate candidate screening and skill matching, thereby expediting the hiring process for recruiters and hiring managers.

Key Features:

Entity Recognition: Utilizes SpaCy's entity ruler to identify and extract entities such as skills and job categories from resume texts.
Skills Extraction: Custom Python functions extract skills mentioned within each resume, facilitating trend analysis and pattern identification.
Text Cleaning: Implements NLTK for text preprocessing, including removal of hyperlinks, special characters, and stopwords, and lemmatization for normalization.
Visualization: Generates histograms, word clouds, and visualizations of entity recognition results to provide insights into job category distributions and prevalent skills.
Custom Entity Recognition: Enhances entity recognition by incorporating additional entities such as job categories and applying custom colors and gradients for visualization.
Resume Analysis: Allows users to input their resumes for analysis, highlighting relevant skills and providing match scores against specified criteria.
Topic Modeling - LDA: Implements Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to identify prevalent themes within the resume dataset.
